# AI-final-project
The project is a model that suggests the best studying technique for a student after predicting his or her final grade. If the final grade that has been predicted is bad, the model suggests that the student be given extra attention'
Most of the features did not have a strong correlation with the target variable so because of this we chose only three features. These features had the highest correlation with the target variable so its helps us predict the best learning style
The user inputs his first grade results which is over 20 and second grade result which is also over 20 to be able to predict the best learning style for the student
